<h1>arch-config</h1>

<p>Some configuration files for my system.</p>

<p>This structure is intented to be managed with tools like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/"><em>Gnu Stow</em></a>.
Generally, you have to install gnu stow and then you run:</p>

<p><strong>stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</strong></p>

<p>This command generates symbolic links to all the programs' files into the appropriate folders.
For example, let's say you want to manage the configuration for <em>ZSH</em>, <em>VIM</em> and <em>i3wm</em>:  zsh has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your .vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and i3 has files in ${HOME}/.i3 and other configs in the ${HOME}.
So, your home directory looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
    home/
        &lt;user&gt;/
            .config/
                terminator/
                ... (some files and folders)
                ... (some files and folders)
            .vim/
                ... (some files and folders)
            .i3/
                ... (some files and folders)
            .zshrc
            .vimrc
</code></p>

<p>You would then create a config  subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<p><code>
    home/
        &lt;user&gt;/
            **arch-config/**
                zsh/
                    .zshrc
                    ... (some files and folders)
                terminator/
                    .config/
                        ... (some files and folders)
                vim/
                    .vim/
                        ... (some files and folders)
                    .vimrc
                i3/
                    .i3/
                        ... (some files and folders)
                    .i3status.conf
</code></p>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<p><code>
$ cd ~/arch-config
$ stow zsh
$ stow i3
$ stow vim
...
...
</code></p>

<p>Now all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are all in the correct place; all of your configuration files  are always available in your arch-config directory, but if you don't need the configuration for one program, you simply don't Stow it and thus it does not clutter your home directory.</p>
